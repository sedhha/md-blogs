Material science and technology has played a major role in the growth and development of today's world-class technologies.From aircraft structures to nanobots, CNTs have performed groundbreaking upgrades in all these domains, but what exactly is a carbon nanotube and what are its properties. Let's have a look at it.

A sp3 hybridized carbon-carbon bond following a hexagonal structure as shown in the above figure is nothing but graphene. These fully networked and densely packed structures offer very good resistance against most of the stress and forces. When graphene is rolled from sheet to cylindrical structure, these specifically folded sheets are known as CNTs or Carbon nanotubes. Based on the number of layers rolled over one another, CNTs can be classified as SWCNTs (single-walled nanotubes) or MWCNTs (multi-walled nanotubes).

In terms of strength, a CNT can be 100 times stronger than structural steel of the same diameter. Generally, we tend to correlate weight from, the denser the material the stronger it will be. Though this can be true to some extent what imparts this exceptional strength to CNTs is the fact that their carbon-carbon sp3 bonding plus their giant molecular structure unlike steel and other elements which tend to develop crack due to smaller molecular structure.


Additionally, the nanotubes are elastic enough to come to their original shape even after high deformation rates. Similar to a rubber band, they don't undergo fatigue easily and support extension to a lot better extent than structural steel. The Young's Modulus of nanotubes is five times more than that of structural steel. Being extremely thin and light, yet offering this much strength is the best example of:

Research and current applications of CNTs

A carbon nanotube reinforcement can be utilised in composite materials. Composite materials are the materials made up of more than one elementary materials and when combined their properties can vary a lot from former materials. Composites are mostly brought to reduce the weight without compromising with strength.
