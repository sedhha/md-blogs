# Uniform Acceleration Kinematics Problem I have been struggling with :P

Hey fellas! How you all doing? So here’s something cool which I would like to share with you, Sometimes as we grow up to become the kind of person we always wanted to be… we tend to miss out those small things which are actually so important to us.

My today’s talk is all about that… As a JEE aspirant when I begin preparing for it, I believe the strongest out of all zones I had in Physics, Kinematics was the strongest for me and perhaps I would have devoted the most number of initial hours to it as well. 

Today I might solve very complex problems related to real world scenarios in my mechanical engineering, but when my younger sister asked me to help with a simple kinematic problem, I just struggled like anything and yet failed so many times. And guess what, I was just going mad about how can I not solve a simple problem, not realizing that I need to calm myself down and focus on my basics to solve it precisely.

So here’s the problem:

*A body covers 200 cm in the first 2 seconds and 220 cm in the next 4 seconds. The velocity at the end of 7th second will be:*

For all the JEE aspirants out there, who are preparing hard for it, this may seem to be a cup of tea for them, but believe me this question tricked me so much that for a moment I started doubting my own skills as if I don’t know anything or as if I just lost everything I had once when I used to prepare for JEE.

So I will type out the solution, which I followed at the end to solve the problem.

I considered equation of motion:

```
s=s0+ut+0.5XaXt^2
```

using this I wrote my first equation as:

```
2=2u+2a———————————-1
```

and the second equation as:

```
2.2=4u+0.5*a*4^2——————————2
```

```
2.2=2+4u+0.5*a*4^2——————————2
```

Can you spot the mistake here? Can you find the correct one? I tried to solve both of these equations and checked and rechecked my calculations continuously, thinking if there could be some very minor mistake concluding me towards the wrong result when finally I realized the blunder I made while writing my equations.

Just look at all the wrong attempts, I kept making to solve this silly problem. While solving the problem I just realized the very silly mistake I have been making…

The first equation of 2 was actually correct with respect to question that was asked, only the u term was incorrect. In the equations of motion u is the initial velocity followed exactly at that instant which I was considering as the very first initial velocity. In simple terms, in the equation:

s=so+ut+0.5XaXt^2

u represents initial velocity which is different when we consider the case 2. where displacement is 2.2m.

And it can be computed as

v=u+at

where u which represents here is the actual u to be used and t=2s.

When I substituted these values finally realizing the biggest blunder I have been making, I finally got my answer 10cm/s which matched with the correct answer.

What I have been trying to convey via this particular blog is that, it helped me realize something, no matter how good we can be at things, consistency is something which is more important than any other thing. If we lose touch or consistency we can possibly lose things out of our hands as well. For a moment, it was difficult for me to believe that I can’t get this small question right, but then I calmed myself down, reflashed all my concepts in my mind and gave it a fresh try.

## CHAT GPT Views

Well coming to the present, 4 years from then, I decided to pitch the same problem to chat GPT. Initially it rejected by saying it cannot be computed, however the second time it did this:
