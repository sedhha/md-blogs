Mathematics has played a crucial role in education and development, no matter whatever be your field, if you lag in mathematics, probably you are going to have tough time out there. But what actually means when we learn maths and when we think like one? If you pass around and see a vegetable vendor who may or maynot be properly educated, but when it comes to total an amount or compute the price of certain quantity of vegetables, he seems to be very fluent.

If we look carefully, he never learned mathematics he may not be knowing those significances and theorems but when it comes to computing digits he is really fast. If you're running out of change and he too fails to provide you with change, he quickly computes an alternative (like adding green coriander leaves with certain weight) which counter balances the change you need to pay.

So what is the difference how can we start computing things in our head and see the world in [perspection of Mathematics](https://www.toppr.com/bytes/mathematics-and-computing/).

Well it's neither too hard nor too easy, it's just how carefully you observe things, if you look deep into the nature and if you have some good familiarity and knowledge about mathematics, you can actually relate mathematics with so many things going around.

You see? If I ask you about certain language like English, Hindi, French or German and If I ask you which are the nations where these types of language are spoken or if you look back in history you will be able to figure out these are the languages created by ourselves to establish a medium of communication and to understand each other better but then when it comes to mathematics, it seems like every single portion of it has been discovered and not created or invented.


The way we humans evolved and the way mathematics has been running and progressing in our lives, at a moment it feels like the entire universe is nothing but just the mathematical model full of equations and variables, almost 90 percent of the phenomenon happening around us can be well explained by mathematics.

From the very first big banf explosion, that led to creation of the universe to the end of universe which is going to take another billion years everything is a mathematical model and can be easily predicted using mathematics.

Another cool example will be discovery of Planet Neptune which is another amazing mathematical phenomenon. When scientist in early 90s started to dig into the solar system, they found a strange orbital movement of Saturn, as if it is going to be thrown out of the solar system due to some external pull.

This created many assumptions and theories out of which one was that a black hole can possibly be very near to solar system and soon it's going to eat up all the planets. But then while solving the equations of trajectory force, they realized that gravity needs to be high enough to do the job, and if it was black hole it would have started pulling all the other planets as well as it is supermassive. Then after many attempts and trial and error this unknown mysterious force finally got its identity and scientists realized that there's one more planet beyond Saturn and this is how Neptune was discovered.

So now you can observe how mathematics can turn all the tables and help you predict about things which are far far away to be reached and discovered. Mathematics is not just a subject, it governs the dynamics of universe, it defines all the physical phenomenon around us and just because we don't carry a valid mathematical justification for any physical phenomenon doesn't mean it doesn't exists or its beyond science or maths, we are slowly progressing and its still a lot long way to go, as we keep moving forward we can see so many things and get their valid explanations as well. All the machines, all the computers, all the artificial intelligence running today are totally based on mathematics and with mathematics one can do so much.

Coming back to our question when can we differentiate between learning maths and thinking like a mathematician.

Learning maths means studying the subject, knowing the topics, solving the challenging problems regarding the same. If I find a person who is learning maths, I can ask any theorem to him he can easily state and probably prove it as well, but beyond that it's the end. It just starts and stops there, no connection can ever be established or even given a thought of doing so for a mathematics learning student.

Whereas for a person who thinks like a mathematician can relate the everyday phenomenon happening around him, from understanding a molecular vibration whose dynamics is governed by higher order differential equations to working of classical physics and modern mechanics, who can see physical phenomenon and finally relate them with the theoretical ones read earlier, that's how a mathematician thinks and seeks for all his questions based on mathematical solutions, a flower petal following a fibonacci series to EM waves which are generated by perpendicular oscilation of electric and magnetic fields, mathematics adds so much logic to why something is happening and can they be altered or controlled.

Last but not the least, creator must be very very brilliant at mathematics and would have programmed this entire world into a mathematical based programming language like maths, otherwise the way things have always made sense would have turned out to be almost impossible the patterns in everyday life, the symmetry possessed by the objects, the flow patterns of a fluid, the rusting time of a metal, the radioactive decay of a radioactive substance and what not. Everything we see today as a part of universe speaks a language called mathematics, sometimes to me it seems as if mathematics is the answer to all our hidden questions and makes sense out of anything, it can explain almost everything and to be very very clear **mathematics can be a bridge to us humans and the almighty creator or god.**
