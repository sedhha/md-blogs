# What Pulls India Back?

India, a country full of festivals, colours and diversified cultures. The way it has grown as a nation facing so many secular, economic and social issues seems to be not less than a miracle. Though there are communities which still use to go for casteism, racism and sexism still the numbers have changed to be better over the years, thanks to the awareness via news and social media.

I am a B-tech student with my passion for science and technology, I love to write about technological advancements and newly discovered scientific theories and gadgets, I spent my early childhood in Assam and then moved to New Delhi where I completed my graduation, further I moved to Vellore, Tamil Nadu where currently I am pursuing my B-tech.

After residing across various parts of India, I realized India has got so much power and so much potential within it, just that it is not working smart enough to grow out of those potentials.

India is a beautiful nation which spends a lot on its people, unlike the United States which spends almost ninety-nine per cent of its economy to the military. In India, people can easily make earnings and be able to survive, this is perhaps a blessing which leads to the world's number two most populated country, ironically which is currently acting as a curse.

We are not able to use the true potential of this big population the way China is doing. In India politics, cricket and Bollywood are so much overhyped that other domains are loosing out and trailing behind, every smart mind, realizing that their potential cannot be utilized to the fullest here end up studying in the country and moving out to work in other nations which creates massive loss to the country itself.

Even though all Indian parents want their students to be academically brighter, but when it comes to real life scenarios very few times that theoretical knowledge seems to be applied practically. Reason being highly established service sector and lagging behind the manufacturing sector.

Today, a lot of things in India are being imported every day from worldwide which can be fabricated within the country itself but there's so much risk involved and it may seize out their livelihood if pursued so no one is willing to risk it.

There are so many other domains where Indians are doing great, but they are never appreciated by Indian media and they are not being delivered the support they need to go up and excel in those domains.

Reservation system also eliminates the deserving candidates, who in turn getting frustrated end up leaving the country and doing great outside. You will find many big Indian names out there as CEOs, CTOs of globally established international companies. But here we need to realize that it may add a few more years of struggle to our lives to stay in India and generate less incomes, but someone has to take the initiative and many such initiatives have to be taken in fields of sports, in fields of technology and many other fields if we want to see India as all-rounder growing nation.

In total it's not that we don't have the potential, it's actually we aren't utilizing it rightly. We as citizens can offer so much to our nation, but we end up thinking about ourselves and degrading the country's progress.

In total, I would like to conclude it's not that we aren't growing at all, slowly we are evolving as well. There are many entrepreneurs coming out every day creating so many employment opportunities, slowly Indians are getting more practical and trying to evolve things. I agree the politicians have gradually destroyed the overall progress for years, but we need to understand that as a regular citizen we can offer so much to our country, our contribution matters a lot more than any other.

We need to grow as individuals, become independent and responsible, take initiatives and help in the growth and development of the nation. We should encourage creating equal oppurtunities in all the domains so that every individual can grow accordingly. We have to stop fighting and comparing among ourselves and build ourselves up as a strong nation which can serve as leading country in all aspects in the world so one day the way people feel proud in standing on lands of New York, Toronto or Sydney is the way people will feel proud to stand in India and no Indian will ever think to leave out this beautiful country ever.
