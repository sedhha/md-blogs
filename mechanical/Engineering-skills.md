# Top Must Have Skills Of Any Engineer

## Good at Mathematics/ Programming

Either it be programming or Mathematics, an engineer should be at least very good with one of those skills. These play a very crucial role in the fields of engineering. Engineers can do so much if they are fluent in any one of these two domains. A good engineer will always be good at any one of these. Engineering involves tons of problem solving and creativity, and someone who is good at maths or programming can definitely be good at solving problems as well. A good engineer should be able to identify the physical equations in their real world and act to their solutions accordingly.

## Good at communication

Effective communication is a key to almost any lock in this world. Same applies for engineering as well. An engineer is an innovator with so many ideas roaming all around his/her head. But it's not just about a big idea, it's about making them happen. And an engineer must be able to convince the authority about his/her ideas so in order to provide their valuable inputs which otherwise will be just wastage if not communicated properly. He/She should be a good presenter, a good speaker and well experienced with these things.

Communication is a bridge between the ideas of an engineer and its execution process.

## Good with their theoretical subjects

Though learning all the theory during engineering may not come into application everywhere but it allows to relate the well-crafted and engineered world. One must be very much strong with their theoretical concepts and always seek to know about what they are doing and why they are doing it. Almost all the engineering subjects and disciplines are interrelated and one can be more understanding towards things if they are well aware of their theoretical concepts.

## Hands on things and good experience working in a team

Experience in engineering is something which matters a lot. Being extremely bright with the theory is going to do no help until the person is experienced by working on projects and research. This helps any engineer to identify the small gap which comes into existence when things are done practically to that when they are worked and planned upon theoretically. Theoretical accuracy needs to be very high to completely replicate a theoretically built system into a practical one and hence it is very important to get some experience by working as a part-time or full-time intern or in any college project.

Along with experience, one should also be good with teamwork. Teamwork is a very essential element in any engineering process. It cannot be done alone, a more involved team with effective communication and bondage tends to be more successful with a more skilled team but no teamwork at all.

## Innovation and creativity

Innovation and creativity is something which needs to be identified in almost every aspect of engineering work. An engineer should be good at solving problems, innovating things and creatively finding solutions.

## Strategic and Entrepreneurship skills

An engineer should always have a strategic approach to their assigned work. They should have a perfect balance of work and personal life. In addition to this, certain entrepreneurship skills also are vital for a good engineer. Having entrepreneurship skills doesn't always mean one should become an entrepreneur. Nowadays, entrepreneurship is needed to grow up any organisation especially the engineering ones. Hence an engineer should also be good with entrepreneurship.
