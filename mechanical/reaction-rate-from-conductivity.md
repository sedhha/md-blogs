# Obtaining Rate of Reaction from Conductivity

Going to the kinematics of first-order reactions, the rate of reaction plays important role in governing its kinetics. Linking the rate of reaction, with conductivity can be tricky at times here’s one way how we can do that:

For this we need to know properly about:

[Nernst equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nernst_equation)

[Equilibrium constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium_constant)

## Forward and backward rate

Now, first, we need to find Equilibrium constant using the Nernst equation, which is given by:

E=E0-(RT/NF)log Q

where

E= cell potential

E0= standard cell potential(Ecathode-Eanode)

R= universal gas constant

T=Temperature of reaction

N= number of ions/electrons exchange

F= Faraday’s constant

Q= Reaction co=efficient

Now at equilibrium Ecell=0 and reaction coefficient= Kc

Hence

LogKc=EoNF/RT

Using this find Kc.

Once Kc is found you could go for calculation of rate of reaction using the equation:

Rf/Rb=Kc.

Another way is by Arrhenius equation.

k=Aexp(-Ea/RT)

k is the rate of reaction.

A is Arrhenius constant

Ea is activation energy

R is universal gas constant

T is the temperature of the reaction.

The same above reaction could be written as

k= Aexp(-dG/RT)

and dG=-NFEo

where N is number of electrons

F is Faraday’s constant

Eo is standard electrode potential

By substituting the correct values in equations, we can obtain the required rate. But getting the right values of A is again a lengthy process so the above method is only suitable if we know Arrhenius constant at that particular temperature.

Or else go with the first method, again it is the relative rate (i.e. rate of forward to backward), for obtaining the absolute rate we need to study reaction stoichiometry and other properties too.
