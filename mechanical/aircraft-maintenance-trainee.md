# My Experience as Aircraft maintenance trainee at AirIndia

Hey guys! So it's not end of my AirIndia internship and here I am, with my new blog it’s all about Aircraft future in India and how possibly it can turn out to be. So right now, I am doing my internship in Air India and believe me there’s so much to learn here.

As an intern in Air India, aircraft maintenance and inspection is one of the primary things which I have been working on. I observed so many cool technologies and people with years of experience working in the same. My first day was all about observation of what actually happens inside the place.

So to the best of my knowledge, there are two big aircraft maintenance industries in India, which are in New Delhi and Mumbai. I have been working in the industry which is located in Delhi, after working with the engineers team there, I am damn sure they are pretty much aware with almost all the aircrafts parts and their positionings. Many of them are also very good with their operations and functionality. Mostly the aircrafts which come for inspection in New Delhi branch are generally Airbus models, and to be specific most commonly airbus a320. Whereas I have been hearing from people that in Mumbai, there are so many other models as well which include bigger aircraft like boeing 777 engines too. So, this pretty much justifies that there’s no doubt that India has a good enough resources and minds to work on commercial aircraft and aviation industries.

During my internship period, one question that kept me thinking was, if we really have super intellect and experienced engineers who put hours of efforts in maintenance of an Aircraft engine, then why don’t they start to work on making their own commercial passenger aircraft. But slowly, after looking around and investigating further, I realized it will take a lot lot more than just experience and knowledge to build a proper commercial passenger Airlines. Though, it is very very tough, but not impossible. And it may take so much of investment at the beginning, but doesn’t matter as long as it’s output results will just boom out the entire manufacturing industry in India with tons of new jobs for many mechanical and civil engineers and saving billions of money every year which could be spent for advancements of other technologies. Here are some of the key factors which I feel are really very important in order to scratch start with production of commercial passenger airlines in India:

- **An Initiative to be taken**: An initiative must have to be taken by someone, who can dare to take such a big project. When I say this, I mean it very deeply… despite of having skillful and completely knowledgeable engineers, if no one can come up to take such initiatives, then perhaps its going to be in vain, someone has to step up an individual or a team, they have to realize that it may be struggling, but if their efforts and legacy is continued… one day it’s definitely going to happen. When it comes to population, India is the second most populated country in the world, unlike many other countries, government here spends a lot on the people by providing cheap living services like food, shelter, clothes etc. but when it comes for the returns, many bright minds end up leaving the nation as they know they ain’t got much to do here… Throughout my engineering college, I have seen many frustrated mates complaining that their talent doesn’t find a way out here in India, whereas when it comes to bigger developed countries, they are given even more opportunities and incomes for what they serve, some even say that they can’t do any good and are forced to move out which is a bad thing. Manufacturing is one of the very important industries in economy and GDP development and to ensure its booming, India has to invest into it and ensure that whatever they provide to its citizens should come in some returns as well, this will only happen if all those skillful minds can stay here and work rather than moving out. We have so many engineers now that we can literally have a dedicated team and expert panels for almost all the departments, it all starts by taking an initiative and working hard on it.

- **Investments**: Initially, the investments are going to be super high. And this fact is one of the major reasons why no indian airline manufacturing companies exist till now. To be honest, the risk is too big to take and this is something really big to do so failure chances are high as well. But it’s not about success or failure it’s all about consistency. This process is not to worry about what if we fail, its about be have to keep trying until we succeed, because its all about that day when we can see a flying commercial airlines manufactured by India. While working for my internships, I saw many engineers out there saying and discussing:

<blockquote>
    Do we really need to study this much of engineering to do these kind of maintenance work? I mean, if we are trained to do this long enough rather than teaching us subjects we will be far better.
</blockquote>

Sadly whatever they say, I found it appealing, I mean it’s really good to know exactly about what you work, but it’s actually not fair that during 4 years of mechanical engineering, we are taught so many beautiful subjects but when it comes to apply those hard worked semester inputs in real life, we get very few chances. There are many industries in India which work on material science, Mechanical testing, Computational fluid dynamics, Mechanical designing etc. but when it comes to comparing those industries with the number of people actually studying mechanical engineering, the picture gets clear that we need some more and large scale industrial establishments to support those inputs provided at initial stage, else all their education will be no more than waste. I have seen people studying hard from mechanical engineering and end up getting placed in IT/ CSE industries for typing and documentation purposes which proves no point for studying mechanical then. India has already become stronger in fields of IT/CSE and if it starts getting stronger in fields of manufacturing and production then only it can go for overall growth.

- **Government based Industry**: If the project of manufacturing commercial airlines ever begins, it should preferably be government based. The industry not only needs a lot of capital but support from airlines industries as well as a lot of land and other resources as well. These commercial aircrafts are giant and so their production unit must take a lot of land and other resources as well. Plus once it is built, it needs to be sold to airline companies so in order to generate revenue, now if the industry starts in partnership with government, then it can easily get most of these including licenses and other subsidies which are necessary to move it further, also it needs a legacy to develop a fully functional airline and hence it seems generally not feasible for private organisations to stretch it that long. So this should possibly be a government programme.

- **Engine design and development**: As stated earlier, I already have seen some exceptional engineers and workshops of aircraft maintenance in India, people are well aware of their working and experienced as well. Many big airline industries like airbus also deals with industries like CFM, royal’s royce etc. for their engines. But compatibility is an important factor in overall production, since the aircrafts made by Boeing or Airbus have their specific design specifications so are their engines, if we start working with our own engines, then it becomes easier while repair and maintenance working as everything is made here itself which adds up a benefit for advanced modifications and design updates. Plus, to ensure manufacturing and fabrication of such complex parts, advanced manufacturing techniques also need to be established. This will not only help in aircraft engine development but many other manufacturing industries can take benefits from them and a good revenue can be generated as well.

So these were some of the important parameters which I believe we lack in order to make a fully functional working aircraft. Though many small aircrafts like 14 seater and 20 seaters are in news but have failed to take off or crashed after some point. One such aircraft is Saras,  which is a 14 seater passenger aircraft made by India. Other than these some important aspects which are generally common in most of the initiatives are careful planning and resource management, records, sustainability analysis etc. Further I have no doubt about India’s caliber in making an airlines as it has smoothly completed making satellites and Martian spacecrafts. But before anything to happen, we all must become super patriotic and dedicated to start with something this big, if it happens it is going to be one of the biggest achievements of India as it will be a fully functional sector involving multiple disciplines and providing so many employment opportunities as well.

Hope you all going good.

See you soon in my next blog!
