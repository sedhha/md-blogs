When we talk about black holes, we see them as supermassive giant vacuum cleaners which just sucks anything in its way, whereas conservation of law and energy is often being confused with the dynamics of a supermassive black hole. There's a big confusion to if a black hole is sucking out the volume of the Universe and may end up eating all of it. Let's try to understand what is actually happening and how it's affecting the overall Universe.

A supermassive black hole is formed due to multiple reasons, like a dying star which ends up turning into a white dwarf or a supernova explosion and so on. The characteristic property of a black hole is that it's very very dense. Dense enough to show the variation in a gravitational pull even at the molecular scales. In simple words, if you're standing next to a black hole, you won't be completely sucked in as a whole, but the very first atoms of your organs which are closest facing to the black hole will start disintegrating one by one and by the time you reach inside a black hole all your body atoms will be disintegrated and spread all around. In other words, you will feel like you're being stretched into a black hole. Sounds horrible? Isn't it?

Well, this happens due to the fact Black holes are a highly dense form of matters and hence following Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation which says

Now since the mass of a black hole is big enough, the distance value plays an important role and gravitational pull tends to increase a lot with time. So this all was about how black holes work now let's discuss if they actually are sucking the free universal space or not.

Since the black holes work on the force of gravitation, hence they can't suck free space. As long as any form of an object is present, either a matter or a wave, black holes can then only pull them in with its massive gravitational force, the pulled object is then highly compressed and densely packed within the black hole with negligible increase in overall density. A black hole can be unimaginably dense enough that a black hole's size whoâ€™s mass equivalent to that of the earth will be just as much as the size of the little finger of your hand!

So in conclusion, we can say a black hole is not violating any energy principle, just twists thermodynamic and other conservation theories to make them slightly more complex. The force field involved with the black hole is gravity and cannot simply just suck in a vacuum, their high gravity plays a vital role in determining most of their properties. I hope you got to know something new after reading this article about black holes.
