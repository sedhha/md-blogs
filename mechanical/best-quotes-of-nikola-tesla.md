Not just a great scientist, but Tesla was also a very good conveyor. Here are some of the very famous quotes of Nicola Tesla which implement in today's world as well:


![I don't care that they stole my idea... I care that they don't have any of their own.](https://cdn.wrytin.com/images/wrytup/r/1024/elon-musk-on-success-1068x561-jw9cg1u8.jpeg)

<blockquote>
I don't care if they stole my idea what I care about is that they don't have their own.
</blockquote>

This statement came up from Tesla against the controversial fight of his with Thomas Edison. The genius beautifully conveyed his message that he is no more into applause and fame. He wanted to create an impact to the society with his inventions. He never was worried about money and fame and that is how he justified his statement.

This one is for all the lonely birds lost in their deep sky out there. Tesla believes that one of the most effective ways for innovative ideas to flow into your mind is by thinking alone. All the great minds think alone and that's the time when genuine ideas flow pass through your mind.

And this one totally gives me goosebumps. Very well said by Tesla, during the time when he used to struggle so much with his idea to be practically implemented. Government and authorities found it redundant and dropped down his towers to stop him from carrying his experiments. Broke out of emotions, Tesla said the present is theirs, those who didn't understand the depth of his inventions, those who mocked his ideas and thought it's totally absurd. But the day will soon come when the world will progress towards betterment of society by science and technology and his unhidden ideas will soon be uncovered by intellects slowly and so it happened, the future today holds all his grids and hence said but the future for which I have worked is mine.

His concept of free electricity which could have totally turned all the tables and provided the entire world by extracting the energy from the atmosphere without degrading any resources was something which just closed with his death. Not just this there were so many other secrets which were burried without any note or written record along with his body. Sadly the world couldn't take full advantage of all his potentials and ideas as an innovator.

This is something even more surprising. Perhaps the most popular inventor of all times, the most famous whose name has been a metaphor for genius when asked how does it feel to be the smartest men alive replied that he doesn't know. The person should go and ask Tesla. No matter wherever we are and whatever we study this guy took the science and technology to a completely next level by giving his special theory of relativity. But to the surprise when he was asked this question, his reply just stunned everyone.

Oh yes! this universe is all about energies, vibrations interactions etc. One must start looking in these terms to understand it better, Tesla was said to observe the effect of free energy within the atmosphere and so he came up with his idea of free energy. Though there are many other popular quotes and mentionings about him these were some of the most popular ones. I hope you liked them.
