Ever thought of building cool gadgets? A robot? Or maybe a smart sensing device? In case you want to begin with, you must be having this cool microprocessor for all your starter projects.

Yes, it's Raspberry Pi. For all the hobbyists out there this cool tiny pocket size computer can do a lot when it comes to applications. With time, the developers have evolved it well to make it even better with supports to wireless communication protocol through Bluetooth and WiFi support.

Thanks to its low power consumption units and multiple peripheral connectivity which allows it to interface with almost any type of connector.

Let us now dive deep down and see which all cool projects you can build up with this cool microprocessor.

# Virtual telepresence using Rpi

Virtual telepresence refers to getting connected to a different spot and being able to see the project virtual environment of that faraway place. A small bot with a camera is used in this purpose. It's navigated by motor control units and the camera's orientation is also changed according to the person's wish. This is a cool technique of examining or inspecting something far away from you with ease.

# Face detection and recognition

A face detection algorithm which is part of computer vision can easily be implemented using Raspberry Pi. Specific features of faces are mapped of a particular person and computer makes use of those features to identify and match and find if the person is the same or someone else. As a microprocessor, the Pi takes image input in terms of arrays and processes those images to find the best match for the same.

# Weather station using Raspberry Pi

Multiple weather-based sensors like gas sensors, temperature sensor, humidity sensor can be integrated together into one system and their data can be packed together and sent all around. A microcontroller like Arduino or Node MCU esp-32 or esp-8266 may be required for the purpose as all the I/O (input/output) pins for Raspberry Pi doesn't have an analogue to digital converter.

Any sensor depending upon its type either sends data via digital format or analogue format. If they are in digital format, the processor doesn't need to decode it back from analogue. But if they sense data and send it in the analogue format then they are needed to decode by using Analogue digital converters. Microcontrollers like Arduino or Node MCU have the functionality of analogue digital converters but Rpi lacks this feature and so is the requirement.

Though the above-mentioned projects are good to begin with. One can actually have so many other nice projects as well. In total Raspberry pi is just like a small minicomputer with so many functionalities which one can even not imagine. You can build powerful robots out of it, communication systems, AIs and a lot more. Some other cool projects in this list include:
