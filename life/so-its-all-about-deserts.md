Deep down inside all of us as humans, our success and desires are pre-defined by the society before even we start with conscious thinking. After being in different kinds of relationships and various social situations, this is just a page to share my experiences and views on:

**Why can’t we live alone? Why do we actually need love?**

This world appears ridiculous to me. Like so many things happen to us and it’s still something confusing to me, is it really in our blood which defines who we are or is it just the situations we are a part of and the things which we go through.

Let’s consider a lonely large desert.

You look around, and you see nothing but the sand and the big mountains. Desert seems so **lonely**, isn’t it? But what it actually takes to survive in such climates. Do you know that the plants and animals which survive into it have a lot of more superior features within them than those who survive in tropical rainforests, or fertile lands and plateau?

It’s neither the fault of this lonely desert that it’s alone nor the other species which are generally not found in such places. Now coming back to ourselves. Consider a person, let’s say him A. A is way ahead of the general crowd when it comes to managing things, holding on to difficult situations, handling multiple tasks at a time, taking care of everyone, making sure no one is troubled and what not. Though A is super good with these things, but when it comes to express himself, he sucks. He doesn’t feel its worth it to show up the emotions openly to the people and others may take it other way round.

People might think, A is rude and doesn’t consider them as part of his life. Just because he chose to keep quiet and not consume his energy over such silly things, he offered everything he can without having any official agenda or self-benefit, the fact is that our A is way too perfect for this world. He cares a lot, he offers a lot, which is totally fine… but the place where he got wrong was that he expected the same from someone who he wanted to be part of his life.

In this process, he tends to expect so much from the people even who can’t offer a little to him, he does so much for the people who aren’t willing to invest even a penny for him and this is why he shields out all of them ending up being lonely.

This definitely is not the mistake of people, but the desert itself, the species which come up to its expectations are able to survive peacefully within its surrounding the others either get eliminated or migrated. It can be said, it’s his own mistake to serve based on return policy. He has so much to offer, in terms of getting something back in return which is not feasible as per the norms of this world. And offering something with expectations in return is also a selfish practice. Attaching ourselves to someone or something based on the greed or hopes of getting things in return is always not the right choice, these strings may conduct one-way transfer, but block up the other way. Instead, the mighty desert should make a choice based on its capabilities and caliber.

Either it can completely give up on being so harsh to let someone walk in or if he doesn’t want to lower its expectations, then it should have a sense of realization that there’s a reason for why it’s lonely in its big space. It’s really tough for others to maintain things up with it and hence it should learn to stay alone. **In the world full of imperfection, even perfection is something which isn’t accepted.**

On the other hand, these deserts may seem to be lonely, but they have so much deep inside. They just need to get dissolved within nature, they should offer whatever they can with no strings attached, and in fact, that’s the best practice. On the other hand, if it’s hurting themselves, then they should immediately give up on that, holding on to things which weighs us down would never ever gonna give us the complete freedom to fly, so it’s better to let go of such things.

Coming back to the question we were supposed to discuss is that **Why can’t we live alone?**

Well, maybe it is true that our personality and our integrity and morality may be a function of our genes and maybe some people never change, but there is always a mold prepared by the everyday life we are part of. We see things around us, we observe, we define our limits based on the people around us, our things end up being relative, the measure of my success depends on what is the range defined by the society, because that’s how I am gonna fit in, which is not at all healthy practice, but since our minds are always under the four walls of thoughts and norms created by society hence we tend to define our life goals, success, happiness, and satisfaction under that, and that’s the reason why we tend to not live alone, because society speaks and projects how awesome things can be when you are with someone else. It really takes so much to get out all these social things from your head and that’s the reason we just can’t live alone.
