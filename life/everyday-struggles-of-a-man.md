# Everyday Struggles Of A Man

We have been hearing a lot about girls, women, pets but this one is for all the guys out there. Just give it a read. I am sure you'll feel good after this.

## Remember those early days, when you first got the taste of those delicious chocolates?

You just wanted to eat them up all, but then came your little sister and finally, at a very tender age, you sacrificed your chocolates to her. Cheers, you lost the chocolate but won her smile! :)

## Remember those mid-school days, when you screwed your exams and helped her out with her depression and studies?

Everyone was shocked about the results and you lied that you played video games all the time, but just two of you knew the real reason. Finally, she fell for you and you two proceeded together after that.

## Remember the day when you wanted to move out of the country for your higher studies?

But then you had to ensure that your sister shouldn't face any difficulties in getting a good college. And so you dropped all your research plans and started hunting for a decent paid job.

## Remember the time, when you were desperately waiting for the moment to meet her back?

After four years of struggle you two saw each other and you both were in tears, looking at each other like crazy. You decided to marry her and informed your parents about the same. Unfortunately, she belonged to a different caste and so you sacrificed the most beautiful thing of your life for your parents.

**True Love: 0, Caste System: 1.**

## Remember the time, when you wanted to work on your dream startup?

But then you realized that you have a family to take care of. Finally, you brought down all your ideas and put your investments and savings for your kids and wife. I know it was hurting so much as the beginning but you realized you got shoulders full of responsibilities now. You are no longer that flying bird. You're a man now.

The times you struggled and ended up hearing from boss and wife, yet all of them trying to get control over you. Finally ending up your life as a compromise for so many loved ones who actually matter with all your compromises in the background like an unsung superhero.

Despite of all this, you just scraped out those joyful moments and happiness of every situation, never made it look the miserable side and that's a good thing indeed!

All others, respect them. You never know what they have done for you. Extend the hands when they need it. It can make them a lot more happier than what you think. :)

## Remember making all these excuses and not doing anything about what you really want ?

Yeah that sucks. So stop worrying too much. Ofcourse there are times when you have to make sacrifices. And that's totally okay. But when you know you're right just do it.
