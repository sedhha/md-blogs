<blockquote>
    We all tend to be in a super rush nowadays. We have dreams for us, we want to do big create impact throughout our life. We are chasing success so badly that maybe we miss out so many things without even realizing it.
</blockquote>



The only toxicity in our minds is that we let it react according to the environment, Environment really plays a key role in defining our perception of things, for example, success, happiness, relationships and what not. Why is it that we want to be big, at least project ourselves as great people, I really don’t understand the purpose of it. At the end of the day, when we are winding up for the final time, these things never gonna matter, the feeling of doing something really good is much better than the feeling of knowing that we projected doing something good.

From the time of my childhood till now, I have changed myself many times. I won’t say changed, a better word will be modified, when I was a kid, I didn’t understand things happening around me, hence I used to go with the natural flow, the flow which started from within and ended within. Things seemed to be quite sorted. No worries, no troubles just peace of mind. As a kid, we tend to do things which we feel like doing, as we grow up we start seeking validation, acceptance etc. Under which we tend to change ourselves to fit in which is not at all a part of a healthy living. Like most of the people, I also tried to do the same, as a high school student, I started losing my true self just to fit in. And in fact, it happens, it’s all spontaneous, we don’t realize it that easily until it transforms us into a kind of person we become on long runs. No one can be blamed for this.

# How to sort yourself out?

Well, its really simple, these are the steps I followed to sort it out. I hope it may work with you too.

- **Be super genuine and spontaneous**: Feel something’s not right? Just say them, you don’t need to consider the consequences of your action if your heart says its right just don’t think of anything else. Don’t split up your personality to please anyone, believe me, it may work for a short time, but it’s gonna mess up for long runs. And maybe your true self may not be appreciated everywhere, but you never need to make fake hopes and promises with yourself.

- **Get out of those dreams and fantasies**: A really important thing, don’t be part of those big dreams all the time, it’s not that stop dreaming but its that just don’t let them take control of your emotions. I have had dreams in my life and I tried super hard to fulfill it, but somehow they slipped out of my hands and yea! it hurts… more than anything, it brings up the pause to your life it just full stops everything for a while. So expect less, have dreams, work hard on it, but don’t link it to your expectations and stuff… in fact, don’t have any expectations, it leads to disappointments. Instead, work on yourself, see how you can make yourself happy, see how you can turn things around you to be the best of what they are. Lesser your desires are connected with this materialistic world, higher are the chances of you to be happy and keep going.

- **Loneliness or solitude? Your call**: We all are part of a different context but same chapters, the way things around us move and the way our minds take it, is the way we grow ourselves and shape our minds. Not all of us suit for all of us,  and if we end up being alone we start worrying about it which is again not needed at all. We need to know that there’s a difference between thinking that we are lonely and thinking that we are in solitude. We can keep ourselves to worry that we are all alone or we can make ourselves to understand that we learn a lot things when we walk alone, we understand ourselves, our strengths and weaknesses, which is really important part to learn in this life.

- **Be expressive**: Open up to people, tell them what you feel. Don’t constrain yourself in your self-defined space, hang out clear up your mind be transparent, don’t let mess accumulate and bug you long enough in your minds, there are so many other things to go into that space.

- **Take small breaks**: Take breaks from life, chill and hang out with friends and family, recharge yourself and then get back to your job. Take out time for your loved ones, show them how important they are, these small things clears up a lot of ongoing mess and helps to stay calm even in stressed up situations.
- **Be friendly to people**: Be friendly, don’t lose calm even in the worst situations, understand the situations of others, never, ever it’s the person who is evil, it’s all situations who make them play those parts by constraining their minds. Don’t let those situations constrain you, always intend to do good things with a good heart, a friendly attitude always brings joy and fun, plus some good people too.

And finally, last but not the least:

- **Clear your heart and help those in need**: Never back off from helping the one in need, clear off your heart and intentions, even with those who mess around. Helping people and knowing that you are the reason for their smile enlightens everything around and makes you feel good. Not just this, it constantly induces pleasure and cheerfulness into the person. These things may seem to be small while reading or analyzing, but their impact can literally boost up your life.
