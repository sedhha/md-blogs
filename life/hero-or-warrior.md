We all are here for a reason. We all want to do something and make our marks, depending upon the type of person we are and the situations we go through, our personality is shaped.

Here I am not talking about choosing between an evil and good, multiple articles on the internet can be found about the same, here the question is a bit tricky and different. It’s between choosing whether to be a real hero or a real warrior. Let’s see what I mean by these terms and what in my opinion is a better choice.

## A hero

A hero is someone who is so so strong from inside, who is emotionally attached to almost everyone, who goes to any limits to make sure he can bring a smile to his loved ones. He can torture himself to death just for satisfaction, validation and maintain his image. Though he never has any narrow expectations, he tries to ensure that he never lets people down because of him. And since he never lets them down, people keep depending upon him, keep imposing things over him without realizing that they are actually messing up his life with their shit. They never actually care for him, but when it comes to showing sympathy they are always good at it. A hero doesn’t know to say no, he sometimes even fail to differentiate between right and wrong just to keep his words or to help someone who is closer to him.

You throw a hero among a pack of wolves and he will return making all of them his friends, he knows the worst of situations, he supports the people around him, he destroys himself to ensure the happiness of those who are never concerned about him, they just know they can take advantage of him whenever they want. He tries to keep everyone happy and ends up being sad himself. A hero is just way too perfect for this world and gets exploited by people around him, he never goes down for his morals, is capable of tackling any situations but emotionally weaker and drains out in such situations.

## A Warrior

Unlike a hero, a warrior never seeks any kind of validation or approval from people around him, he knows only one thing and that’s his duty. He is capable of going through the worst of situations like a hero but avoids it as much as possible, he never pleases people, and he never cares about everyone. He has a limited circle of people who matter the most for him, for them he can go any limits, to ensure that they are in peace, but apart from those people he doesn’t care about the others. He has a path to follow and whatever comes in the way he chops it off.

He just believes in one thing and that is

`No matter what, Always do the right thing.`

Unlike a hero, he never confuses or deviates from his life principle based on the influence created by the people around him, he always goes with his gut feeling about always doing the right thing. And once decided what is right, he never considers any other opinions. He has no strings attached to the people or this materialistic world, he has no agenda or he doesn’t want any appreciation from the public, he doesn’t care what people think about him he just knows one thing and that is to do the right thing. He never postpones or filters his plans just because of other’s opinions, he knows that those who matter don’t mind and those who mind don’t matter. He has crystal clear view about his goals, ideologies, and morals.

He is never confused about his morals and values by the influence of the world, even looking at unfair practices around him giving easy solutions, he prefers to stick to difficult one as that one is right. Throw a warrior among a pack of wolves and he will return leading them.

## So a hero or a warrior?

Well, both of them are having a tough time, both of them have some limitations and both of them face things which we can’t even imagine. But to be honest, when I look deep into it, I find that instead of just becoming a hero or instead of becoming a warrior all the time, a person should experience both of these phases once in life, starting with the hero at an early age and then transforming into the warrior later on.

I feel a person cannot directly become a warrior if he hasn’t ever been a hero and faced those difficult situations, hybridization of these two is what actually can help him become a true warrior for long runs. Both of these characters play a very important role in molding the lives of an individual. Being deceived, fooled and exploited, a hero discovers so many things and all these bitter experiences are the things which transform him into a real warrior.
