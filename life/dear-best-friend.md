## The day when your dad was mad at you.

I understood you're not having a good day and I was quiet when you took out all your frustration over me. I understand that sometimes we need to recharge ourselves and so did you. I will always support you when you are down. Remember? This is what friendship is all about.

## The day when you tried a different outfit in the college and everyone was mocking at you.

I did stand for you. I understand we all have preferences and sometimes our experiments can go wrong. I know deep inside you were crying hard but then you just smiled and moved out. Later when I came to you, you just cried hard and hugged me tight and I said everything will be alright and see today it is.

## The day when I expressed my feelings about you.

And you just said we aren't meant to go like that way, you might think I got alright with it but deep inside I was super hurt. I can't sense things around me for a moment. I felt as if I was all broke and nothing left to live anymore still I did.

## The day when she asked me out I got totally confused.

What hurts more to be rejected by someone whom you love or to reject someone who loves you? But then I just told her not to pursue this because honestly, I don't want anyone else.

## The day when he was mad at you, and you were crying out loud doubting your worth.

You know I had my final exam the very next day, but when you called me I just took everything aside and tried helping you out of all this. You just felt enlightened and then told me that I am the best. I know I lost my marks but I was happy that you're finally alright.

## The day when you were packing out things.

He said he was busy with his project you called me up and I had to cancel my basketball match for that. And after hours of hard work, you took me for an ice cream treat. That was so sweet of you.

## The day of the farewell party when you were totally drunk and thought I am him.

You came close to me and tried kissing me. Do you know how much I wanted to kiss you? But then I respect your decisions and choices more than my desires, so I just pushed you off and ran out of that party back to my room. Believe me, I was weeping all the time after what all happened. And you know what? I am a strong boy, I don't cry that easily.

## The day when I won the match for our team.

We got a gold, I wanted to tell you about how much struggle and efforts we put for that one important match but you told you had a fight with him and were having a rough day, I just kept quiet and listened to all your pain and feelings.

## Finally, the day when you guys totally wanted to push out of the systems and he just got mad over you pushing you out of his car at the gas station in a complete rainy day.

I just slipped off while playing and was badly injured, but guess what I just rushed to you when I got to know you're all alone there. You were crying all night because of what happened and you guys broke up, at the moment I was happy but after watching you like this I felt bad and even called him to sort it out once, but everything seemed to be in vain.

Thanking you for everything

*Dedicated to all single sided lovers who fall in this stupid trap and keep pursuing it as if nothing else matters. Everything in the world is temporary my friends except your true self! I hope you enjoyed this content but at the same time I wanted to convey a message that its okay to let go of people and move on in life.*
